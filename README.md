# Ergodic-Control-using-Tensor-Train
This repository is a python implementation of ergodic control using tensor train format corresponding to the paper: 
- "Ergodic Exploration using Tensor Train: Applications in Insertion Tasks" by Suhan Shetty, Joao Silverio, and Sylvain Calinon

Use the notebook Ergodic_Control_using_TT.ipynb. You can use google-colab to run this notebook (Just copy the url of this github repo in https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true).
